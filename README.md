# LunarPebble
LunarPebble is a mod for Forge, Fabric and Neo-Forge that adds a small pet rock called Pebble to your game!

We aim to add a variety of companions to the game, from rocks that carry your gear to boulders that protect you from danger!

## Why is this even a thing?

This mod was started because I wanted to enter a pebble creating competition in a [cool discord](https://discord.gg/MDtfugqu5w) but couldn't be bothered to go outside and grab a pebble so I spent 10 times as long (minimum) making this mod. After wich, Lunar proposed to make this an actual mod for the community and other people who would want a pet rock!

We do not rely on any other mods in order to function, all you need to do is download it from your platform of choice and run with it!

## Adding your own Pebble

This part is still under development, but you will be able to add your own pebble in the code itself
[Link to documentation here]

## TODO
- [ ] Fix fabric not working
- [ ] Add crafting recipe's
- [ ] Add behaviour and storage slots
- [ ] Make documentation how to make your own pebble
